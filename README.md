# Split Drizzle schema into multiple files

This is a minimal Next.js application using Drizzle and SQLite/Turso to demonstrate how to split your Drizzle schema into multiple files. Drizzle schemas generally have all of the tables defined in one file, which is simple, but can become unwieldy as your application grows. Splitting each table into its own file is an elegant solution for scalability and organization.
